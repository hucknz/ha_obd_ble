# Nissan Leaf OBD BLE — Home Assistant Custom Integration

A Home Assistant custom integration for monitoring Nissan Leaf battery and
vehicle data via a Bluetooth Low Energy ELM327 OBD-II adapter (e.g. LeLink2).

This integration is a fork of
[pbutterworth/nissan-leaf-obd-ble](https://github.com/pbutterworth/nissan-leaf-obd-ble)
with the following additions:

| Feature | Original | This fork |
|---|---|---|
| OBD adapter selection | Manual MAC entry | **Dropdown of discovered adapters** |
| Generation support | Manual overrides.yaml | **Built-in per-generation profiles** |
| ZE0/AZE0 odometer | Active query (unreliable) | **Passive CAN broadcast (0x5C5)** |
| ZE0/AZE0 battery decoder | ZE1 offsets (incorrect) | **Correct ZE0 byte offsets** |
| Sensor list | Fixed (all sensors always created) | **Trimmed to generation-supported set** |
| Data persistence | Lost on HA restart | **Persisted to HA storage** |

---

## Supported hardware

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| LeLink2 ELM327 BLE OBD-II adapter | Primary tested hardware |
| Any ELM327 BLE OBD-II adapter advertising as `OBDBLE` | Should work; UUIDs configurable |
| ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy (e.g. GL-iNet GL-S10) | Recommended for garage setups |

## Supported vehicles

| Generation | Years | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ZE0 | 2010–2017 | Odometer via passive CAN broadcast; ZE0 battery decoder |
| AZE0 | 2017–2018 | Same as ZE0 profile |
| ZE1 | 2018+ | Active KWP2000 odometer; includes e-Pedal sensor |
| Auto | All | All sensors enabled; uses ZE1 decoders (ZE0/AZE0 owners should pick their generation for accurate battery data) |

## Prerequisites

### Python library

This integration depends on a **forked version** of the upstream Python
library that adds generation profiles and passive CAN monitoring:

```
https://github.com/hucknz/py-nissan-leaf-obd-ble
```

Home Assistant will attempt to install it automatically from the git URL in
`manifest.json`.  If auto-install fails (some HA setups restrict this), install
it manually in the HA Python environment:

```bash
# SSH into your HA host
pip install "git+https://github.com/hucknz/py-nissan-leaf-obd-ble@main"
```

Then restart Home Assistant.

---

## Installation

### Option 1 — HACS (Custom Repository)

1. Open HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories.
2. Add `https://github.com/hucknz/ha_nissan_leaf_obd_ble` with category **Integration**.
3. Find *Nissan Leaf OBD BLE* and click **Download**.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### Option 2 — Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/ha_nissan_leaf_obd_ble/` folder into your HA
   `config/custom_components/` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## Setup

1. Plug the OBD adapter into the Nissan Leaf's OBD-II port and turn on the
   ignition (or accessory mode).
2. In Home Assistant: **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration →
   Nissan Leaf OBD BLE**.
3. **Step 1 — OBD adapter**: Select your adapter from the dropdown.  If it
   doesn't appear, check that it's powered and within BLE range.
4. **Step 2 — Leaf generation**: Select your Leaf platform.

   | Label | Choose if… |
   |---|---|
   | ZE0 — 2010–2017 | Your Leaf is a pre-facelift (original) model |
   | AZE0 — 2017–2018 | Your Leaf is the 2017 or 2018 refresh |
   | ZE1 — 2018+ | Your Leaf is the second-generation (40 kWh / 62 kWh) |
   | Auto | You're unsure — all sensors enabled, ZE1 decoders used |

5. **Step 3 — BLE UUIDs**: Leave at defaults unless your adapter uses
   non-standard GATT UUIDs.
6. Click **Submit**.  HA will create the device and all generation-appropriate
   sensor entities.

## Notes on ZE0/AZE0 battery data accuracy

The battery decoder byte offsets for ZE0/AZE0 (`state_of_charge`,
`hv_battery_health`, `hv_battery_Ah`) are based on community research and
testing on a 2016 Nissan Leaf.  They have not been exhaustively verified across
all ZE0 and AZE0 vehicles.  If you notice incorrect battery figures, please
open an issue with your raw LBC data.

---

## Configuration options

After setup, click **Configure** on the integration card to adjust:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Fast poll interval | 10 s | Polling rate when the car is on and in range |
| Slow poll interval | 300 s | Polling rate when in range but car is off |
| Extra-slow poll interval | 3600 s | Polling rate when out of BLE range |
| BLE service UUID | `0000ffe0-…` | GATT service UUID for the adapter |
| BLE read characteristic UUID | `0000ffe1-…` | Read characteristic UUID |
| BLE write characteristic UUID | `0000ffe1-…` | Write characteristic UUID |

---

## Data persistence

Sensor values are saved to HA's `.storage/` directory after each successful
poll.  After a Home Assistant restart, all sensors immediately display their
last known values — no need to drive the car home first.

---

## Troubleshooting

**No adapters appear in the dropdown**
: Ensure the OBD adapter is plugged in, the ignition is on, and the adapter
is within Bluetooth range of your HA host or a Bluetooth proxy.  Check
*Settings → Devices & Services → Bluetooth* to verify HA can see the adapter.

**Sensors stay at last known value indefinitely**
: This is the persistence feature working as designed.  Values update the
next time the car is in range and the ignition is on.

**Incorrect battery / SoC values on a ZE0 or AZE0**
: Ensure you selected the correct generation during setup.  If you used
*Auto*, re-add the integration and select *ZE0* or *AZE0* explicitly.

**Enable debug logging**
```yaml
# configuration.yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.ha_nissan_leaf_obd_ble: debug
```
